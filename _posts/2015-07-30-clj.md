### Expectations

[Expectations](http://jayfields.com/expectations/index.html) is a minimal unit testing framework and assertion library build on the idea of "one assertion per test". I prefer using it as an alternative to clojure.test for small projects.
 
{% highlight clojure %}
;; Assertions follow the format: (expect expected actual)

(expect 1 1)
(expect 3 (count [1 2 3]))
{% endhighlight %}

### Leiningen

[Leiningen](http://leiningen.org) is a project build and dependency management tool for Clojure projects which focuses on a declarative syntax for specifying configurations for projects.

Follow the instructions [here](http://leiningen.org/#install) to set it up.

Once installed, hit ```lein version``` in a terminal to verify everything works.
You should something similar to ```Leiningen 2.5.1 on Java 1.8.0_45 Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM``` as the output.

---

### Generate a new project

From a terminal, use ```lein new app [app-name]``` to generate a new project based on the 'app' template. Leiningen creates a folder with the specified name, creates the necessary directory structure withing it and populates it with sample code.

{% highlight bash %}
$ lein new app mathworks
Generating a project called mathworks based on the 'app' template.
$ ls
mathworks
$ tree mathworks/
mathworks/
|-- doc
|   `-- intro.md
|-- LICENSE
|-- project.clj
|-- README.md
|-- resources
|-- src
|   `-- mathworks
|       `-- core.clj
`-- test
    `-- mathworks
        `-- core_test.clj

6 directories, 6 files
{% endhighlight %}

Open ```project.clj``` and add expectaions as a dependency.

{% highlight clojure %}
(defproject mathworks "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "Mathworks"
  :license {:name "Eclipse Public License"
            :url "http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html"}
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.6.0"]
  		[expectations "2.0.9"]])
{% endhighlight %}

---

### Write a (failing) test

By default, leiningen will generate a test folder with a failing test based on clojure.test. Open up ```test/mathworks/core_test.clj``` and change it to use Expectations as below:

{% highlight clojure %}
(ns mathworks.core-test
  (:require [expectations :refer :all]
            [mathworks.core :refer :all]))

;;Failing test
(expect 0 1)
{% endhighlight %}

---

### Add a test runner
We now need a plugin that allows us to run the tests via leiningen. I prefer using [lein-autoexpect](https://github.com/jakemcc/lein-autoexpect) because it re-runs all the tests whenever there is a change in the source code. This a blessing given the long load time Clojure has.

To add the pluging, specify it in your ```project.clj```:

{% highlight clojure %}
(defproject mathworks "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "Mathworks"
  :license {:name "Eclipse Public License"
            :url "http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html"}
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.6.0"]
  		[expectations "2.0.9"]]
  :plugins [[lein-autoexpect "1.6.0"]])
{% endhighlight %}

*Note: The double '[[' is required for leiningen to read the file correctly event though we only have one plugin.*

---

### Run the test
Navigate to the folder containing project.clj and run ```lein autoexpect```. (First time runs may take a while since leiningen resolves and fetches dependencies from the web)

The output looks like:

```
$ lein autoexpect

*********************************************
*************** Running tests ***************
:reloading (mathworks.core mathworks.core-test)

failure in (core_test.clj:6) : mathworks.core-test
(expect 0 1)

           expected: 0 
                was: 1

Ran 1 tests containing 1 assertions in 22 msecs
1 failures, 0 errors.
Tests completed at 11:44:08.846
```

Notice that the command doesn't exit immediately since autoexpect is watching for changes. 

Modify ```core_test.clj``` to look like:

{% highlight clojure %}
(ns mathworks.core-test
  (:require [expectations :refer :all]
            [mathworks.core :refer :all]))

;;passing test
(expect zero? 0)
{% endhighlight %}

Go back to the term with autoexpect running and you should see that the modified test has completed:

```
*********************************************
*************** Running tests ***************
:reloading (mathworks.core-test)

Ran 1 tests containing 1 assertions in 5 msecs
0 failures, 0 errors.
Tests completed at 11:57:07.381

```
